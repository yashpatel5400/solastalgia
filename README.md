Solastalgia is gonna be a bomb game about climate change

# Current Overview
## Sample scene
Solastalgia is currently in its prototyping stages. The current layout of the scene is as follows. The black box is your house (starting location), and the idea is that you'll be going to the colored houses (objectives) in this order: blue->purple->red->yellow->pink

Which correspond to these buildings and picking up these people:

| Color: House type       | Description |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Blue: Lower class house | Picking up food from a merchant for another client; you're good friends with this local merchant |
| Purple: Business building/skyscraper | Delivering the food you just picked up from before; business guy needs to be dropped off at city hall for a meeting |
| Red: City hall | Drop off business client and pick up politician; wants to go to the "projects"/lower class areas |
| Yellow: Projects building | Show the politician around; wants to get dropped off at house after |
| Pink: Upper class house | Drop off politician |
